what are the advantages of the lambda expression ?

LAMBDA expression only applicable in the FUNTIONAL INTERFACES only

1  to minimise and concise the code
2  to maintain code easily and it improves the readability
3  to enable funcion al programming in java
4  to enablke parallel programming
5  JAR file reduction means reduce the Zip size of the code
6  Elimination of the Shadow variables



no return type, no access modifier, no name                just like this   ()->{}     by seeing examples you can learn more

One more we learn at this point--->When to use the extends An d WHen to use the Implements

extends -----> used for to inheritent the 1.   class to class   2. interface to interface 

implements ---> used for to declarating the interface methods in class/ inn other word for declaring the concrete methods    there we use the  "implements" keyword


// one more Thing is that

   we can not process the data in interfaces  because there is no main method in interfaces,   
   so in class only we can process the data and get the result as well.
